# string2agb
Converts strings according to a so-called table file in order to be re-compiled with an arm assembler, useful for creating strings in romhack build scripts.

# Building string2agb

string2agb uses the most common command line parsing utility available for C# "CommandLineParser" which can be obtained via nu-get: Install-Package CommandLineParser. This is, in order to be consistant with the style of many commandline utilities written in C# 
out already.
